    <h1>The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) Hydroelectric Project</h1>
    <p>The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), formerly known as the Millennium Dam, is a 6GW hydroelectric power
        project under construction on the Bine Nile River in Ethiopia.
  <br>
        Being developed by state-owned public utility enterprise Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation, Grand Renaissance
        Dum will be the biggest hydropower station in Africa.

    <p>It is also one of the world's most controversial dam projects as it involves a long-running international dispute
        between Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan over the Blue Nile water sharing. Ethiopia accounts for more than 80% of the
        Blue Nile water in its territory alone and the downstream countries Egypt and Sudan fear the dam construction
        will reduce the water flow on the river and cause drought-like situations in their territories.</p>

    <h3>Location and river details</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
        <li>The Grand Renaissance hydropower project is located on the Blue Nile, which is a major tributary of the
            world's longest river the Nile River contributing up to 80% of its water during the rainy season.</li>
        <li>The Blue Nile originates at Lake Tana in north-western Ethiopian Highlands and runs for approximately 1,450
            km to meet another major tributary the White Nile in Khartoum, Sudan.</li>

        <li>The Grand Renaissance Dam is being built at a narrow point on the Blue Nile approximately 40km downstream of
            its confluence with the River Beles and approximately 15km upstream of the Ethiopian-Sudan border.</li>
        <li>The project site is located approximately 500km north-west of capital Addis Ababa in the Benishangul-Gumaz
            region of Ethiopia.</li>
